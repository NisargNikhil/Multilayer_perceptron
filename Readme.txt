Project Title:

multilayer perceptron model using Pytorch

About:

This model uses multilayer perceptron to distinguish between two distinct group of data points which cann't be bisected 
using a straight line.

Dataset used:

The dataset has been created using sklearn's library "datasets.make_circles" to form circles of two distinct group of data
points. 500 random sample of points were generated to form two circles with noise of 0.1 which gives deviation of the data
points and factor of 0.2 which simply means the inner circle is 20% of diameter of the outer circle 

Library used:

Torch
Numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
torch.nn
sklearn
